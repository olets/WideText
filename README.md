#WideText

v2

WideText easily makes the font size of one or several lines of text responsive  
It's like Nermal to [the wonderful] [BigText](https://github.com/zachleat/BigText)'s Garfield: younger and lighter.


Bonuses: Under 800b of vanilla js, runs just once on load (works on window resize events without rerunning)  
Drawback for some: won't work on IE < 8

##Useage

**Make text fully responsive simply by wrapping it in `svg.widetext text` and running `wideText()`**  
The **Text** content will be as **Wide** as the full width of the `svg`'s relative containerâ€¦ it'll be **WideText**!  
The `svg` will be sized to fit the text content.

*Note there will likely be some bordering space between the text content and the `svg`, because the `svg` will be sized to contain the largest possible character, from [ascender line to descender line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface_anatomy#/media/File:Typographia.svg) and including room for [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic).*

**Center- or right-align the text by adding the `data-align` attribute to the `svg`**  
Takes "center" or "right"

**Break the text into several lines by wrapping each line in a `tspan`**  
The longest line will be the full width of the `svg`,  
and all other lines will get the same font size as the longest.  
*Note: remove whitespace between `tspan`s or you'll get trailing and/or leading space.*

**Adjust the space between lines of text by adding `data-leading` to the `svg`**  
Takes em values; including the "em" unit is optional (either .2 or .2em will work)  
*Note: this isn't line height, it's the space between successive lines of text.*

##Examples:

**Script**

	wideText();

**Markup (basic example)**

	<svg class="widetext">
	  <text>
	    minimal example
	  </text>
	</svg>

**Markup (full example)**

	<svg class="widetext" data-leading=".5em" data-align="center">
	    <text>
	        <tspan>a full example</tspan><tspan>with multiple lines, alignment, and custom leading</tspan>
	    </text>
	</svg>

##Options:

To target `svg.customSelector`, run `wideText('.customSelector')` (WideText enforces targetting an svg).

You can pass an array of options like

	.wideText({
		leading: .5,
		align: 'right'
	})

Multiple instances are fine:

	.wideText();
	.wideText({
		selector: '.wideText.spaced-big',
		leading: 3
	})

The available options are

option	| default 		| possible values
---	 	| ---			| ---
selector	| '.wideText' 	| string
leading 	| .2 			| number (e.g. .2) or string (e.g. '.2' or '.2em')
align 	| left align 	| 'center' or 'right'
