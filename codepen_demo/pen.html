<span class="heading widetext">
    WideText: simple responsive font sizing for one of more lines of text
</span>

<h2>To see WideText at work, resize your window and watch that ^ heading. To really see the magic, make your window narrow until it compresses the white boxes.</h2>

<p>The max-width, outlines, and visible background are just to make it clear what's happening in this demo - in the wild, this would just look like text (comment out or remove any of the "just for demo purposes" styles to test).</p>

  <h3>An example of how several widetext svgs in a single container can be used for interesting typography</h3>
  <p>Remember that the background color and outlines are only for demonstation purposes - in practice you'd probably just style this to match the rest of your text. This example also demonstrates the ascender line to descender line sizing of the svg: it will necessarily be big enough to hold the tallest and longest possible characters.</p>
